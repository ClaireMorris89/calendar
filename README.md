# Calendar

## Description

I wanted a website that can store daily calendar reminders in a simple way. As a user navigating to this page, you can easily see the current date and time, as well as time blocks for each hour of an 8-hour work day. Each time block is color coded based on the current time, and can have individual tasks and reminders applied to the hour that it corresponds with.

Building this website taught me how to use jQuery to add event listeners, make conditional statements, as well as locally store/call items.


## Usage

This website can be used to keep track of daily tasks during an 8-hour work day. It can help you stay on track by color-coding current and future tasks/events that need to take place, as well as reminding you of past events that you've completed.
